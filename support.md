# Support
 
OSSEC provides a wide variety of community support options available for
our users, including:

* OSSEC Users Mailing List – Installation, configuration and usage issues.
* OSSEC Development Mailing List – Everything regarding development/code.
* Getting Involved – How you can contribute to the project
* Contact Us – All other questions.
* Commercial Support Options

## OSSEC Users Mailing List

Questions about installation, usage and configuration should be sent to
this list. It has a low volume of messages (around 120/150 per month)
and is the best way to have your questions answered.

Please note that the “community” support is provided by volunteers, and
even though they will do their best to answer and help you, this may
not be always possible. The rules are: be polite and provide enough
information so everyone can understand your issue.

To subscribe to the ossec-list:

* Send an e-mail to ossec-list+subscribe@googlegroups.com with the 
  subject of Subscribe ossec-list.
* Messages should be sent to: ossec-list@googlegroups.com  
* List archives are available here or at [http://marc.info/?l=ossec-list].

To unsubscribe:

* Send an e-mail to ossec-list+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.

## OSSEC Development Mailing List

Development questions, patches and anything related to coding should be
sent to the ossec-dev list. It has a very low volume of messages (around
20/30 per month) and is highly technical.

To subscribe to ossec-dev:

* Send an e-mail to ossec-dev+subscribe@googlegroups.com with the 
  subject of Subscribe ossec-dev.
* Messages should be sent to: ossec-dev@googlegroups.com.  List 
  archives are available at [http://marc.info/?l=ossec-dev].
